List of companies sharing their terms on github

## Get Involved and Participate

To have your company added to this list, first, get your terms onto GitHub, or some other openly available version control system. We recommend structuring your repository like this: `COMPANY_NAME/policies`.

Then, once your policies are live, either send us a pull request with your company's name and the url of your repository, or send us an email (bill at funnymonkey dot com) and we'll add it ourselves.

**ProTip**: use the html to markdown converter at https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/ to convert your policies to markdown.
